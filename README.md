# 🐍 Python Journey – 100 Days of Python

This repository contains my Python projects and exercises completed as part of the “100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp” by Angela Yu.
The focus is on building strong Python fundamentals through hands-on practice and mini-projects.

## 📌 About This Repository

* Covers Python concepts from basics to intermediate level

* Includes daily practice programs and small projects

* Emphasis on clean code, logic building, and consistency

* Projects are implemented incrementally as part of a structured learning journey

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Practiced

* Python fundamentals (variables, data types, control flow)

* Functions and modular programming

* Loops and conditional logic

* Working with files

* Basic error handling

* APIs, Turtle, Pandas, Tkinter

* Problem-solving and logical thinking

* Writing readable and maintainable code 

* Each folder represents daily practice or a small project focused on a specific concept.

## 🎯 Purpose

* This repository demonstrates:

* My learning consistency

* My approach to problem-solving in Python

* Practical understanding of Python concepts through implementation

* It is intended as a learning portfolio rather than production-ready software.
